Data Description
-2 No mention of potential unseen issues (e.g., sampling bias)

Note: For the final report, please load the data from an URL instead of local data/ folder.

Question
No deduction.

Note: No deduction was applied for lacking predictor justification because the EDA results imply the rationale. In the final report, explicitly state this reasoning (e.g., "EDA shows variable X has this trend, suggesting it is a good predictor for Y") or use domain knowledge.

EDA and Visualization
No deduction.

Methods and Plans
No deduction.

Note: KNN can incorporate categorical variables (such as player experience and gender) if properly encoded, so this is not a true limitation. Given the scope of this class, no marks will be deducted for stating it as such in the proposal, but it will not be accepted as a valid limitation in the final report.
